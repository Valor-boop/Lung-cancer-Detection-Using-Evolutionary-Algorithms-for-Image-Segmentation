# Lung Cancer Detection Using Evolutionary Algorithms for Image Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources associated with the research paper titled "Lung Cancer Detection Using Evolutionary Algorithms for Image Segmentation" authored by Patrick Bernhard, Pavel-Dumitru Cernelev, and Ben Tomkinson.

## Abstract
The research focuses on improving early lung cancer detection through the implementation of evolutionary algorithms, specifically Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Multi Swarm Optimization (MSO), for image segmentation. The proposed model integrates adaptive inertia weight and adaptive learning rate to enhance unsupervised hierarchical segmentation of lung cancer CT images generated by PSO. Hierarchical segmentation enables monitoring tumor changes over time, aiding in treatment response assessment and treatment decision-making.

## Contents
- **Code:** The repository contains the codebase used to develop the unsupervised hierarchical segmentation model using PSO.
- **Data:** Sample CT scan images of lungs used for evaluation are provided.
- **Results:** The results obtained from testing the PSO model on CT scans and comparing them with the baseline K-means model are documented.
- **References:** A list of references cited in the research paper is included.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the code directory and execute the main program to run the segmentation model.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the code to input CT scan images and observe the segmentation results.
